# The Google Cloud Quiz App 

Since several of the engineers at Leverege (the IoT solutions provider at which I work) were studying for Google Cloud certifications, I decided to make a quiz app to help them out. 
This minimalistic quiz app, written with jQuery, allows users to test their knowledge of questions likely to come up on the Google Cloud Data Engineering certification.
